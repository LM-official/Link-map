# Link-map
This repository hosts my personal Knowledge Base managed via Obsidian.
The graph visualizes the information architecture and the interconnections between the various technical.

# Content/:
# Graph structure:

    - core (red): the central node 0_HOME acts as the primary hub for navigation.
    - macro domains (yellow): the graph branches out into distinct areas of expertise such as 0_DEVELOPMENT, 0_SCIENCE, 0_MATH_LOGIC, 0_SOCIETY_HISTORY and 0_ARTS_MEDIA
    - thematic clusters (green): rach domain is hierarchically organized into specific nodes (e.g., 2_PYHTON, 4_JAVA, 5_C) to structure concepts in a modular way.
    - intermediate hubs (purple): sub-clusters acting as bridges between broader themes and specific content, organizing dense topics into manageable sections.
    - atomic notes (grey): the granular leaf nodes (e.g., pythonCheatsheets.md, javaClassHierarchy.md) representing specific concepts and the actual content of the documentation.
This structured approach enables me to maintain a clear high-level overview while diving into the technical details.
# Filenames:

    - each hub has a filename in uppercase and snake_case
    - each node has a filename in camelCase
    - each node has type tags in [documentary, guide, tool]

# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
